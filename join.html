    <h1>Join Us</h1>

    <p class="page-intro">
      We currently have <strong>three openings</strong> for a <strong>Master’s thesis / internship</strong> project at the
      <strong>von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics (VKI)</strong>. Projects are typically carried out within the
      <strong>Erasmus program</strong>, with an ideal duration of <strong>4–6 months</strong>.
    </p>

         PROPOSAL 1
         ========================= -->
    <section class="join-proposal">
      <h3>Proposal 1: Non-Intrusive Diagnosis of Interface Waves in Liquid Metal Coatings Using Image Velocimetry and RBF-Based Reconstruction</h3>

      <h4>Context &amp; Problem</h4>
      <p>
        Industrial liquid metal coating processes are highly sensitive to interface instabilities, which can severely degrade
        coating quality. To address this, VKI is developing <strong>non-intrusive, real-time sensing techniques</strong> to detect
        and characterize interface waves within these flows.
      </p>

      <h4>Methodology</h4>
      <p>
        This thesis will refine a diagnostic approach combining <strong>real-time image velocimetry</strong> with
        <strong>Radial Basis Function (RBF)</strong> interface reconstruction algorithms. Building on encouraging preliminary results,
        the student will improve the robustness of the reconstruction procedure and conduct an extensive validation campaign in
        the <strong>AmeLie</strong> experimental facility.
      </p>

      <h4>Expected Outcomes</h4>
      <p>
        The project will bridge experimental data processing and algorithm development. The results will provide a more accurate
        tool for real-time monitoring, with direct applications in industrial coating optimization.

         PROPOSAL 2
         ========================= -->
    <section class="join-proposal">
      <h3>Proposal 2: Experimental Investigation of Motion Control in Semi-Submersible Floating Wind Turbine Platforms</h3>

      <h4>Context &amp; Problem</h4>
      <p>
        Floating wind turbines are essential for deep-water energy harvesting, yet they face significant stability challenges.
        Platform oscillations induced by wave loading can adversely affect turbine performance and structural integrity.
        There is a critical need for control strategies that mitigate these motions without interfering with the turbine’s aerodynamics.
      </p>

      <h4>Methodology</h4>
      <p>
        The study utilizes a scaled semi-submersible floater equipped with <strong>water-filled chambers</strong>.
        By actively adjusting internal water levels via pumps, <strong>tunable damping</strong> is introduced to counteract pitch motions.
        The student will design and integrate wave/motion sensors, manage real-time data acquisition, and develop closed-loop control
        strategies to regulate internal fluid distribution.
      </p>

      <h4>Expected Outcomes</h4>
      <p>
        The project will demonstrate the feasibility of decoupling hydrodynamic stabilization from aerodynamic control.
        The findings will provide practical insights into improving the stability and structural longevity of offshore floating wind platforms.
      </p>

         PROPOSAL 3
         ========================= -->
    <section class="join-proposal">
      <h3>Proposal 3: Low-Order Dynamic Modeling of Variable-Pitch Propellers under Rapid RPM and Pitch Transients</h3>

      <h4>Context &amp; Problem</h4>
      <p>
        The next generation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) requires enhanced agility and efficiency.
        Variable-Pitch Propellers (VPP) offer a solution by allowing drones to adapt their effective angle of attack to varying flight conditions.
        However, controlling these systems during fast maneuvers is difficult due to the complex, transient aerodynamic behavior that occurs when both
        RPM and blade pitch change simultaneously.
      </p>

      <h4>Methodology</h4>
      <p>
        This project aims to develop a <strong>low-order dynamic model</strong> of a VPP. Building on existing <strong>Wiener-structure</strong> models,
        the student will characterize the inertial, aerodynamic, and actuator-induced delays that dominate transient thrust.
        Experimental data will be collected from rapid step and ramp changes in VKI facilities to parameterize the model and capture
        nonlinear coupling effects between control inputs.
      </p>

      <h4>Expected Outcomes</h4>
      <p>
        The work will result in a validated, reduced-order model suitable for real-time flight controllers.
        This will enable more aggressive UAV maneuvers and optimized energy consumption by providing a precise mathematical framework for transient VPP performance.
