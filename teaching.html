      <h1>Teaching</h1>

<p>
  Since 2019, I have taught primarily at the
  <strong>von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics (VKI)</strong> in the
  Research Master (RM) program. This one-year, English-language
  Master-after-Master (60 ECTS) combines advanced courses with an
  individual research project. The cohort is highly selective, with
  about 30–35 students from around 16 countries each year. All students
  already hold a Master’s degree—usually in aerospace or mechanical
  engineering, physics, or applied mathematics—and some are already PhD
  candidates. Their strong preparation creates a stimulating environment
  at the interface between graduate education and active research.
</p>

<p>
  In addition, I regularly teach in the VKI Lecture Series: week-long
  intensive courses in fluid dynamics, aerodynamics, thermodynamics, and
  computational methods, taught in English to graduate students,
  researchers, and industry professionals by leading experts in their
  fields.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Courses Taught.</strong>
  My teaching trajectory began in 2018 with contributions to the course
  <em>Differential Equations for Fluid Dynamics</em> (DEFM). In 2019, I
  took full responsibility for this course, which I reformed and
  broadened into <em>Fundamentals of Fluid Dynamics</em> (FFD).
</p>

<p>
  Today, I serve as the main instructor and coordinator for six full
  courses and contribute to three others. I am also the primary academic
  lead for a new specialization within the Research Master program:
  <em>Data-Driven Fluid Mechanics</em>. Furthermore, I direct the annual
  <em>Hands-on Machine Learning for Fluid Dynamics</em> lecture series,
  which is approaching its sixth edition and has been attended by over
  700 participants worldwide. I also co-organize lecture series on
  <em>Particle Image Velocimetry</em> (two editions) and on
  <em>Flow Control</em> (inaugural edition in 2026) in collaboration with
  Prof. Discetti (UCM3), as well as the lecture series
  <em>Machine Learning for Fluid Dynamics</em> (two editions) in
  collaboration with Prof. Parente (ULB).

      <p>
        The following gives a brief overview of the material I cover in the courses at the Research Master programme
        (full information available on the VKI syllabus:
        <a href="https://www.vki.ac.be/images/education/RM_SYLLABUS_2526.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Fundamentals of Fluid Dynamics, FFD (22 h, 2.5 ECTS). Started in 2017 as DEFM, adapted in 2019.</strong> —
          A graduate-level review of the core principles and advanced concepts of fluid mechanics. The course begins
          with the derivation of conservation laws in integral and differential form, flow kinematics, and constitutive
          relations, then progresses through incompressible, inviscid, and Stokes-flow models, dimensional analysis,
          and similarity theory. Advanced topics include vorticity dynamics, dispersive and non-dispersive wave propagation,
          and the fundamentals of both modal and non-modal stability analysis, with an emphasis on eigenfunction-based
          formulations and transient growth mechanisms. The course provides students with a rigorous foundation and the
          analytical tools required to formulate and analyze problems of research relevance.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Signal Processing (second part), SPII (12 h, 1.5 ECTS). Started in 2019.</strong> —
          A graduate-level course that revisits and deepens key concepts in spectral and time–frequency analysis for
          analog and digital signals. The course covers the sampling and discretisation of continuous-time systems,
          including the link between differential equations and recursive relations, the use of Laplace and Z-transforms,
          and the mapping of poles and stability properties between continuous and discrete domains. It then addresses the
          transition from continuous to discrete Fourier transforms, generalized linear transforms and associated
          inner-product structures, wavelet transforms, and multiresolution analysis. The module further introduces the
          design and implementation of digital filters (FIR and IIR), with particular attention to real-time versus offline
          processing. Finally, the use of filter banks for data decomposition, multiresolution representations, and signal
          reconstruction is presented through applications drawn from engineering and applied physics.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Introduction to Measurement Techniques, IMT (4 lectures, 25% of the course). Started in 2019.</strong> —
          This module covers both the fundamentals and selected advanced techniques in experimental fluid mechanics. My
          contribution includes four lectures organized in three modules:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <em>Principles of Measurement Systems</em>, introducing statistical treatment and Linear Time-Invariant (LTI)
              theory for measurement, static and dynamic characteristics, uncertainty propagation, and system calibration
              through impulse and step responses;
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Image Processing for Optical Metrology</em>, presenting core concepts in image enhancement, linear and
              nonlinear filtering, and anisotropic diffusion methods; and
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Introduction to Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV)</em>, outlining the principles of optical velocimetry,
              from hardware configuration and particle dynamics to image interrogation and post-processing. This last module
              covers two lectures.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Tools for Scientific Computing, TSC (12 h, 1 ECTS). Started in 2022.</strong> —
          An optional course introducing open-source computational tools for addressing practical problems. The course
          begins with the fundamentals of Python programming and core scientific libraries
          (<code>NumPy</code>, <code>SciPy</code>, <code>Matplotlib</code>), then covers tools for numerical methods and data
          processing, as well as more advanced topics such as object-oriented programming, graphical user interfaces,
          machine-learning libraries (mainly <code>scikit-learn</code>), and good practices for debugging, packaging, and
          version control using GitHub.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Data-Driven Modal Analysis, DDMA (12 h, 1 ECTS). Started in 2022.</strong> —
          Introduces the mathematical and physical foundations of coherent-structure identification in fluid dynamics.
          It begins with a review of linear algebra and numerical factorizations—QR, eigenvalue decompositions, and singular
          value decomposition (SVD)—which underpin the construction and interpretation of modal bases, and the link between
          the discrete and continuous settings, including a brief review of Hilbert spaces. It then presents the classical
          approaches of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), including their use for
          Galerkin-projection-based reduced-order models. The course concludes with advanced extensions such as Multiscale
          POD, Spectral POD, and a brief introduction to operator-theoretic methods rooted in resolvent analysis.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Machine Learning for Fluid Dynamics I, MLFD (12 h, 1 ECTS). Started as Data Driven Fluid Mechanics (DDFM) in 2021, adapted in 2025.</strong> —
          Introduces the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their application to flow problems. The course
          begins with a review of essential topics in numerical linear algebra, probability theory and calculus, followed by
          the general formulation of learning as a functional-approximation problem, emphasizing training, generalizability,
          and statistical consistency. It then covers linear and nonlinear parametric regression methods—from Radial Basis
          Functions to Artificial Neural Networks—together with the fundamentals of numerical optimization used for their
          training.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Machine Learning for Fluid Dynamics II, MLFD II (24 h, 2 ECTS). Started as Data Driven Fluid Mechanics (DDFM) in 2021, adapted in 2025.</strong> —
          Complements the previous with advanced topics framed within the Bayesian and kernel-based formalisms. The course
          covers Gaussian Processes and their multifidelity extensions, Bayesian optimization, and the kernelization of
          inner products for nonlinear regression. It also introduces linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods
          (bridging to data-driven decompositions) and provides an overview of generative AI concepts. Throughout, the
          emphasis is on integration with engineering applications in fluid dynamics, including turbulence modeling,
          inference, and super-resolution through penalized learning and architectural constraints.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Digital Twinning, Data Assimilation and Control, DTAC (18 h, 2 ECTS). Started in 2024.</strong> —
          Focused on the real-time modeling and control of fluid systems within the framework of digital twinning. The
          course begins with the fundamentals of microcontrollers and electronics (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESP32) for
          real-time monitoring and basic control using simple sensors and actuators, complemented by laboratory sessions.
          The second part covers nonlinear system identification through recursive least squares and adjoint methods, and
          data assimilation via Kalman filters and their extensions. The final module discusses model-based and model-free
          control strategies, including an introduction to reinforcement learning and the modern actor–critic framework as
          well as a brief overview of reinforcement twinning.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Hands-on Machine Learning for Fluid Dynamics (32 h, 3 ECTS). Started in 2021.</strong> —
          An intensive one-week course designed for both VKI Research Master students and external participants (typically
          around 100). It integrates selected material from MLFD I, MLFD II and DTAC into a cohesive, tutorial-based
          program centered on practical implementation. Since 2024, RM students enrolled in the <em>Data-Driven Fluid
          Mechanics</em> specialization and external participants have attended the same core program, although additional
          lectures are provided to RM students before and after the workshop to complement the hands-on component.
